# Personal Website (WIP)
-----------------------
> I was bored when my junior fall semester started and decided to mess around with web development.
> Nothing too fancy, I wanted to practice HTML/CSS, eventually implementing JS features for interactivity.
> Development dropped when my semester picked up, but I realized the website looks awful when viewing from my phone. This made me research more about responsive design, but I have not found the time to implement these changes as I would likely have to redesign my website with responsivity in mind.
